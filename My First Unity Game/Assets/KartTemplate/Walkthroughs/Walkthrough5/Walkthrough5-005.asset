      m_Text: "In this Walkthrough, you\u2019ll learn how to build your game. In this
        context, the term build is a verb, but you will also see it being used as
        a noun, as in \u201Ca build\u201D of your game. \n\nSo in game development,
        the act of exporting all the content of your game is called building the game,
        and the result of that process is called \u201Ca build\u201D, a version of
        your game that you would share with others so that they can play it."
